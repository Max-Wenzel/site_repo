Today we discussed how we are going to finish up the project! We also discussed our thoughts for how we are going to present milestone 6during our recitation.
The things that we still want to get done befroe we turn in this project are: 
* simplify the way student users view TA's schedules
* make the sign in page look nicer
* Work on user sign in, authentication, and logout
* work on adding courses
* see if we can allow TA's to add photos
